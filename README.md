# t

Quick and dirty world clock for the command-line.

Install with:

```bash
go get github.com/cv/t/cmd/t
```

And then:

```bash
$ t sfo jfk
SFO: 🕓  16:06:21 (America/Los_Angeles)
JFK: 🕖  19:06:21 (America/New_York)
```

Any IATA airport code can be used, and will pick the timezone of that airport.

That's it!
